# {BIVA}: Bayesian Instrumental Variable Analysis

## About

Randomized experiments are the gold standard for impact measurement.
However, it is common that the treatment of interest cannot be
directly randomized, like the usage of a feature, or participation in a program.
Instead, nudges to use the feature or join the program are randomly assigned
to induce the treatment of interest, but units can choose not to comply
with the assignment, hindering simple analysis. This package, BIVA
(Bayesian instrumental variable analysis), helps unlock flexible
impact measurement for randomized experiments with noncompliance.

## Installation
It can be installed from GitHub directly using devtools package in R. The CRAN version will be submitted soon.

```R
library(devtools)
install_github("google/BIVA")
```

## Usage

Examples for how to apply the BIVA workflow can be found in the 'vignettes' folder.
