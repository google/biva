# {biva}: Bayesian Instrumental Variable Analysis <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" height="138" alt="" />

Randomized experiments are the gold standard for impact measurement.
However, it is common that the treatment of interest cannot be
directly randomized, like the usage of a feature, or participation in a program.
Instead, nudges to use the feature or join the program are randomly assigned
to induce the treatment of interest, but units can choose not to comply
with the assignment, hindering simple analysis. This package, BIVA
(Bayesian instrumental variable analysis), helps unlock flexible
impact measurement for randomized experiments with noncompliance.

## Installation

You can install the development version of biva from [GitHub](https://github.com/google/biva) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("google/biva")
```

## Example

Examples for how to apply the BIVA workflow can be found in the 'vignettes' folder.
